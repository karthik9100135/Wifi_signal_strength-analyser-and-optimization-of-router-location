The Wi-Fi Signal Strength Analyzer scans available networks, displays RSSI values, and allows selection of a specific SSID for analysis. It maps signal strength across a room and suggests optimal router placement to improve coverage, reduce dead zones, and ensure better wireless performance through spatial visualization and data-driven insights.
The Wi-Fi Signal Strength Analyzer is a comprehensive tool developed to evaluate and optimize wireless network performance in indoor environments. The system begins by scanning all available Wi-Fi networks and displaying their SSIDs along with corresponding signal strength levels, typically measured in RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values. Once a user selects a specific network (SSID), the tool enables the collection of RSSI data from multiple points within a room or environment.

Using this data, the analyzer visualizes the spatial distribution of signal strength, helping users identify strong and weak signal zones. These visualizations make it easy to understand how walls, furniture, or distance from the router affect signal quality. To enhance network performance, the system includes a router optimization feature, which provides intelligent suggestions for repositioning the router to maximize coverage and minimize dead zones.

Built with a modular architecture, the project separates GUI components from backend functionalities. The graphical interface offers an intuitive user experience, while the backend handles scanning, data collection, and visualization logic. Overall, the Wi-Fi Signal Strength Analyzer is a practical solution for both home users and professionals aiming to assess and improve their wireless network performance effectively.
