The Wi-Fi Signal Strength Analyzer scans available networks, displays RSSI values, and allows selection of a specific SSID for analysis. It maps signal strength across a room and suggests optimal router placement to improve coverage, reduce dead zones, and ensure better wireless performance through spatial visualization and data-driven insights.
